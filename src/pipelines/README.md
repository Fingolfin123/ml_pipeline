# 🔁 Pipelines Module Checklist

Defines end-to-end orchestration logic for the machine learning workflow, using tools like Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or custom orchestrators.

---

## 🏗️ Workflow Construction

- [ ] Define directed acyclic graph (DAG) or flow for ML pipeline
- [ ] Configure task dependencies and execution order
- [ ] Parameterize pipeline runs (e.g., by date, model, environment)
- [ ] Support local and cloud execution modes

---

## 🧱 Modular Task Design

- [ ] Create reusable tasks/operators for each ML component:
  - [ ] Data ingestion
  - [ ] Transformation
  - [ ] Feature engineering
  - [ ] Model training
  - [ ] Evaluation
  - [ ] Inference
  - [ ] Monitoring
- [ ] Encapsulate logic into clean, versioned functions or classes
- [ ] Use configuration-driven inputs and outputs

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- [ ] Track pipeline runs, task statuses, and durations
- [ ] Integrate with logging tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Expose metrics for dashboarding or alerting
- [ ] Handle errors and retries with clear audit trails

---

## 🔁 Scheduling & Automation

- [ ] Automate recurring runs (e.g., daily, hourly, on data arrival)
- [ ] Define schedules using cron or event-driven triggers
- [ ] Support backfilling and reruns

---

## 🔐 Environment & Secrets

- [ ] Manage credentials securely (e.g., Airflow Variables, Prefect Secrets, Vault)
- [ ] Use environment variables and context-aware configuration
- [ ] Support different runtime environments (dev/test/prod)

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Unit test tasks and flows independently
- [ ] Run dry-runs or mock executions
- [ ] Validate data and model artifacts between steps
- [ ] Include pipeline-level assertions (e.g., schema checks, model thresholds)

---

## 🌍 Deployment & Scaling

- [ ] Package and deploy pipelines to orchestrator (e.g., via Docker, Kubernetes, CLI)
- [ ] Support parallel and distributed task execution
- [ ] Optimize pipeline for performance and fault tolerance
- [ ] Version pipeline definitions and track changes over time

---

> ✅ Tip: Keep pipelines declarative, modular, and observable to enable continuous improvement and safe experimentation.
