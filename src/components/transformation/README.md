# 🔄 Data Transformation Module Checklist

This module contains logic for cleaning, normalizing, enriching, and restructuring raw data into features suitable for modeling. It acts as a bridge between ingestion and training/inference.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- [X] Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal)
- [X] Detect and treat outliers
- [X] Remove or flag duplicates
- [ ] Validate schema and data types
- [ ] Correct inconsistent formatting (e.g., casing, punctuation)

---

## ⚙️ Normalization & Scaling

- [ ] Normalize numerical features (e.g., MinMax, Z-score)
- [ ] Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot, label encoding)
- [ ] Apply domain-specific transformations (e.g., log scaling, date encoding)
- [ ] Track transformations applied for consistent inference

---

## 🏗️ Restructuring & Enrichment

- [ ] Flatten or nest complex/nested structures
- [ ] Aggregate data at required granularity (e.g., time series, customer-level)
- [ ] Generate new derived features (e.g., ratios, time windows)
- [ ] Join with reference or external datasets

---

## 🧾 Metadata & Logging

- [ ] Record input/output schemas
- [ ] Version and hash transformation steps for reproducibility
- [ ] Log row counts, feature distributions before/after
- [ ] Support feature store integration (optional)

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Validate transformations on small sample subsets
- [ ] Confirm invariants (e.g., value ranges, no data loss)
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases and known data anomalies
- [ ] Store sample transformed datasets for downstream validation

---

## 🔄 Reusability

- [ ] Modularize transformation logic into reusable components
- [ ] Parameterize transformation pipelines (e.g., column names, thresholds)
- [ ] Export reusable transformers (e.g., `scikit-learn` Pipelines, PySpark transformers)

---

> ✅ Tip: Keep transformation logic consistent across training and inference to avoid data leakage or skew.
