# 📊 Evaluation Module Checklist

This module includes model evaluation metrics, validation routines, error analysis tools, and experiment result tracking. Use this checklist to guide implementation and ensure consistent model assessment across experiments.

---

## 🧪 Validation Strategy

- [ ] Implement cross-validation (e.g., k-fold, stratified, time series split)
- [ ] Train/test split with consistent random seed
- [ ] Holdout validation set (e.g., for hyperparameter tuning or blind test)
- [ ] Nested cross-validation for unbiased model comparison

---

## 📈 Metrics (Classification)

- [ ] Accuracy
- [ ] Precision, Recall, F1-score
- [ ] ROC AUC, PR AUC
- [ ] Confusion matrix
- [ ] Log loss
- [ ] Calibration plots and Brier score

---

## 📉 Metrics (Regression)

- [ ] Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- [ ] Mean Squared Error (MSE) / Root MSE
- [ ] R² Score
- [ ] Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- [ ] Quantile loss / pinball loss (for quantile models)
- [ ] Residual plots

---

## 🔍 Error Analysis

- [ ] Identify systematic errors by segment (e.g., user groups, time periods)
- [ ] Analyze misclassifications or outliers
- [ ] Visualize prediction distributions
- [ ] Compare predictions vs. actuals with scatterplots or lift charts

---

## 📁 Result Tracking

- [ ] Log evaluation metrics per experiment
- [ ] Store model version and hyperparameters alongside metrics
- [ ] Track evaluation date/time, author, and dataset version
- [ ] Save results in CSV, JSON, or experiment tracking system (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases)
