# 🧠 Explainability Module Checklist

This module provides tools to interpret and explain model behavior and predictions, using techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and global/local interpretability strategies.

---

## 📊 Feature Importance

- [ ] Compute global feature importance (e.g., Gini importance, permutation)
- [ ] Compute local feature importance (e.g., SHAP values per sample)
- [ ] Visualize ranked importance of features
- [ ] Store and version feature importance outputs

---

## 🔍 Local Explanations

- [ ] Generate explanations for individual predictions
- [ ] Use SHAP, LIME, or custom surrogate models
- [ ] Provide visual summaries (e.g., waterfall plots, force plots)
- [ ] Allow user-specified input for ad-hoc local analysis

---

## 🌐 Global Explanations

- [ ] Summarize how the model behaves across the dataset
- [ ] Use SHAP summary plots, partial dependence plots (PDP), ICE plots
- [ ] Analyze interactions between features
- [ ] Visualize clusters or decision boundaries (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP)

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Validation

- [ ] Sanity check explanations (e.g., random baseline, model sensitivity)
- [ ] Track consistency across retraining
- [ ] Compare explanations between models or versions
- [ ] Store explanations alongside model versioning artifacts

---

## 📁 Integration & Reporting

- [ ] Export results to visual dashboards or notebooks
- [ ] Support interactive tools (e.g., Dash, Streamlit, Jupyter)
- [ ] Log explanation metadata (e.g., model ID, input sample, timestamp)
- [ ] Enable auditability and traceability for predictions

---

## 🔁 Reusability

- [ ] Wrap explainers into reusable functions or classes
- [ ] Parameterize for multiple model types (tree, linear, neural)
- [ ] Abstract explainers to support different backends (e.g., sklearn, XGBoost, PyTorch)
- [ ] Create templates for batch or on-demand explanation jobs

> ✅ Tip: Use explainability early in the ML lifecycle—not just for compliance, but to build trust and guide improvements in data, features, and models.
