# 🚀 Inference Module Checklist

This module contains logic for generating predictions in both batch and real-time (online) settings. It includes model loading, inference pipelines, deployment hooks, and prediction formatting. Use this checklist to ensure your model inference is reliable, scalable, and production-ready.

---

## 🧠 Model Loading

- [ ] Load model from serialized format (e.g., `.pkl`, `.pt`, `.onnx`, `.joblib`)
- [ ] Validate model version compatibility
- [ ] Support dynamic model selection (e.g., from config or registry)
- [ ] Test deserialization across environments

---

## 📦 Batch Inference

- [ ] Support processing large files (e.g., CSV, Parquet)
- [ ] Run predictions over distributed or batched data
- [ ] Write output in a consistent format (e.g., with timestamps, IDs)
- [ ] Log batch run metadata (e.g., run time, input file, version)

---

## 🌐 Online Inference (API/Streaming)

- [ ] Accept input via REST API or message queue (e.g., Kafka)
- [ ] Preprocess and validate incoming requests
- [ ] Return predictions with low latency (< 100ms if real-time)
- [ ] Handle edge cases and malformed input gracefully
- [ ] Expose health and readiness endpoints

---

## 🪝 Deployment Hooks

- [ ] Post-prediction logic (e.g., thresholds, business rules)
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline or deployment service (e.g., AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI)
- [ ] Register models in registry after deployment
- [ ] Trigger monitoring or logging system after inference

---

## 📊 Prediction Output

- [ ] Include prediction confidence scores or probabilities
- [ ] Tag outputs with model version, timestamp, and metadata
- [ ] Format predictions for consumption by downstream apps (e.g., BI tools)
- [ ] Ensure reproducibility from the same input data

> ✅ Tip: Run shadow mode (silent) deployments during staging to validate inference logic before serving live traffic.
